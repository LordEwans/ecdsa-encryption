# ECDSA Encryption

This is a simple golang project where I try to simplify encryption and decryption using a pair of ECDSA keys through ECIES. There's no practical use for this, it's just for learning purposes.

## Install dependencies

```bash
go mod tidy
```

## How to run

```bash
go run main.go
```

To test the encryption and decryption on specific messages, you can modify the `main.go` file.
